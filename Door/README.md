Just a door that uses the two side panels.

I hacked it up in OpenSCAD, the hinges just pound into the extrusions,
and the pin is just a piece of filament.

Used [magnet tape](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005HYDC68/) to hold it shut and seal it.
Put the tape on the door first, then stick the extrusion side to the tape so it holds, then
close the door to attach it.  Seems to be the only reliable way to line up the poles.

The holes in the hinge leaf part of the frame are in case I needed to drill through the acrylic
and push a piece of filament through to hold it on... I didn't need to.

I left the 1mm foam tape on the side panels, which made it fit tightly in the channel.

The hinges should likely be undercut a bit more to centre the door on the frame.
